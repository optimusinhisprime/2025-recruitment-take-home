## IT DEPARTMENT 2025 RECRUITMENT TAKE HOME ASSESSMENT

### INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the Take-Home Technical Assessment for the PrepaidPlus Merchant Portal project.
This exercise is designed to:
-	Evaluate your ability to implement a real-world feature in a production-like environment.
-	Test collaboration skills: seeking clarification, managing Git workflow, and structuring maintainable code.
-	Provide you with a fair experience that mirrors how our team works day-to-day.

NB:

-The backend APIs for authentication already exist. Your task will be to build the front-end authentication flow that integrates with them.
-You will be compensated for your time at the rate of a freelance junior developer being P220.00 per task completed (P880.00 if all 4 tasks are completed).

### TIMELINE & SUPPORT
-	Intro Meeting (Monday Afternoon)
-	Kick-off call with senior dev (overview, setup help, Q&A)
-	Assessment Duration: 4 Days (Monday – Thursday)
-	Be prepared to walk us through your code during the Friday/Saturday session
You will work independently, but you are encouraged to reach out for clarification via call, email, or WhatsApp.
Any changes must be committed and pushed to the designated GitHub repo with appropriate documentation.
You will be provided a framework7 codebase, postman collection, and a github repo to work with.
